Project 4
Name: Nikita Yaroshevsky
Class: Dynamic Web Applications


This web application serves as online video player. I am planning on expanding this project and create a online video aggregator. 
This project specifically tackles the problem of adding the favorites functionality so that certain channels could be remembered 
and stored for quick access.
